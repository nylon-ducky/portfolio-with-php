            <p>
                My name is Zachary Durso. Some people call me <span class="tooltip">Zenia<span class="tooltiptext">(zen eye uh)</span></span>, and some call me Durso, but most just call me Zach because to me, a name is just a name, and it could just as easily be something like "Raspberry" or "Cardboard". So take your pick, and lets carry on.
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm a very passionate person, and I love a lot of things! Most importantly, I love my family, my partner Michael, and my two guinea pigs, Shmoopie and Doopie. I love animals, anything with fur. I love soft, plush, thick sweaters and most winter wear, and I also really love my hobbies.

            <h3>Cooking</h3>

            <p>Aside from coding, I really enjoy cooking. My most well recieved dish is pulled pork, and I'm pretty sure it's because I put so much love, time, and effort into it. So here's how I do it! I use bone in pork butt, also known as the pork shoulder. It's a really fatty, flavorful cut, and the texture is very pull-apart-able, so it's really just the best cut for the job. Bone-less also works, but honestly, I hate it. It's never been as good as the bone in. I always put a dry rub on it, consisting of whatever I feel like in the moment, so it's never exactly the same, but it's usually got a base of kosher salt, brown sugar, some garlic powder, and then some <em>smoked</em> paprika because its basically dry barbecue sauce. Then the stuff you wouldnt expect. Dry mustard (or you could grind up some mustard seeds in a mortar and pestle, or even just use plain yellow mustard), and ... are you ready? GRAPE JELLY! I know, it sounds weird, but try it and you wont be disappointed. Then I put it in the crock pot, usually for about 24 hours. This ensures that all the flavors get incorporated nicely, and most of the fat gets rendered out. That doesn't mean you don't have to be careful about painstakingly pulling it apart though. No matter how long you cook it, some fat will remain, and cooking it for so long also effects the bone. This gets all the flavor out, but also makes it very brittle. You could probably break it in half with your bare hands, so if you're using utensils to shred the pork, you might wind up with a bone shard in there if you're not careful. Thats why I always do it by hand. The bone also makes a great treat for your dog too, which is an awesome added bonus! Then I just mix it all up with some Sweet Baby Raysâ„¢ and put it back in the slow cooker to get nice and hot. I also love making fresh bread, and the two of them together is a match made in heaven!

            <h4>Nails</h4>

            <p>
                Another one of my hobbies is nail art! I actually went to school for cosmetology, but decided it just wasn't nwhat I wanted to do with my life. However, the skills I gained from that experience have been absolutely invaluble. I can cut my own hair, as well as that of all my loved ones, and I learned a lot about working with nails and acryllic. These days I don't use acryllic though because of the smell, so now I'm working with gel. Being introduced to the world of gel nail products has been amazing! Gel polish lasts so much longer, has a much brighter shine to it, and so does the builder gel, used to strengthen the natural nail or sculpt an entirely new nail from scratch. These products also have nearly no smell to them and are totally cured within about a minute or so under a UV light, which means no more messing up your nails before the polish has dried. I love my nails, I keep them very long. They're usually one solid color, but what I really get excited about is decorations! I love using cubic zarconia because it has such an awesome sparkle to it, but I also use some more 3D elements too. For instance, I Just got some scull beads. These are really meant for jewelry making but I thought They'd be perfect for nail art. It's a variety pack with a few different kinds of sculls in it. In particular, I really love the cow sculls because they've got horns on them. Which I think is super cool, and super cute! But the best part is, the all have cubic zarconia for the eyes! I love these things, and they are definitely my favorite decorations to use.

            <h5>Thats me!</h5>

            <p>
                On a more personal level, I identify as transgender, but at the end of the day,
                <span id="me">I am simply Me.</span> Whatever that may be to you. I don't particularly care for labels because everyone is an individual and I feel like labels take some of that away. So thank you for taking the time to get to know me, a friend, a colleague, or simply
            </p>
